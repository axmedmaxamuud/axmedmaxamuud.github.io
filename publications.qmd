Hi there! I have some new publications on data science, geospatial analysis, and mapping that could be incredibly useful for anyone working in the humanitarian field. Whether you're interested in using data to solve complex problems or mapping to understand critical situations, these publications cover a lot and hope they can add value to your work or spark new ideas.
